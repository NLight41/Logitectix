# Logitectix

**Logitectix** is a modular, context-driven C++ architecture that redefines the way we write, think, and structure logic.  
It is designed by [NLight41](https://github.com/NLight41), a logic reconstruction enthusiast and semantic framework thinker.

## ??What is Logitectix?  

Logitectix is not just another competitive coding template.    
It is a **semantic dispatch system** that uses `Context`, `Stage`, and **intent-based modular flow** to replace the traditional `main()`-centered design.  

It encourages:  
- ?? Clarity of logic over procedural chaos  
- ?? Flow-based dispatch over flag-driven branching   
- ?妝 Structural separation of input / solve / output   
- ?? Scalable and extensible module injection

## ? Core Philosophy  

> ?nstead of learning how to code faster, why not rethink how code should be written???  

Logitectix is born from the idea that **programming is language**, and languages require **semantics, context, and modular clarity**.    
It aims to move beyond "writing instructions", into "weaving meaning".
